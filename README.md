# Sage-Datapacks
Upscales and refreshes Minecraft's combat and exploration.
Split into modules:
- <b>Retooled</b> adds the Hammer and Spear, weapon traits that give almost every tool a   combat role, trinkets that allow for things like special combo attacks, double jumps, and poison immunity
- <b>Apocalypse</b> makes most mobs more difficult, but in more interesting ways than straight stat increases.
- <b>Frostbite</b> adds a temperature system so that biomes may need infrastructure to be survivable.
- <b>Hellscape</b> makes the nether tougher by adding Radiation, makes Netherite much more accessible, and adds a new material made of Diamonds and Ender Pearls named Pearlescent Alloy.
- and <b>SideIron</b> adds guns!
